# Story Structure 

This is the basic story structure that I like to use as a skeleton when beginning to script my stories. It is based on presenting a problem, explaining it at length, really digging into the pain point, and then bringing the audience to the solution. Obviously, every talk is different and it won't always follow the problem-solution format, but it helps to have someplace to start. 

## Engaging Opening 
This is the hook of you story, your funny opening, your question or unexpected comment that will draw the audience in. Opening the pain point that you're trying to make them feel deep down in their soul. Using the audience is great, or even making up other characters, as you can thread them into your entire talk. 

## Story Buildup

This is where you build the problem with suspense, highlighting the issues with this problem and all the pain it causes. 

## Possible Solutions

Since you're here to solve a problem, offer possible solutions. This is important for two reasons: 
- Your final solution might not be available or relevant for everyone in the audience 
- There will be critics who will ask why you didn't use a different industry known solution for your problem. This is a way to get all those questions out of the way through explaining that you tried them, and these are the reasons they didn't work. 

## Story Peak (aha moment)

This is where you dramatically present your solution, and explain why it works better than others. This is where you slow down your speaking pace. 

## Story Breakdown 

Explanations, diagrams, code, maybe? This is where you show everything there is to know about your solution. 

## Close the Circle 

_Always_ close the circle. Always bring it back to the beginning. It helps the audience realize that you finished your talk (so you don't end on an awkward "umm that's it") and it also creates a mental sandwich for your audience that will make it easier to pack everything you said into one idea.
